# Familiarizing with the Project

*April 15, 2023*

#### Background

- Researched the Human Genome Project and the current progress on GP-Write
  - [GP-Write Website](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org/)
- Talked with Dominic about the work he has done

#### Code

- Gained access to the GitHub repositories for Frontend and Backend through Amy Cayne
- Read through the files on both in an attempt to learn about the codebase

<br>

- Attempted to get the Frontend running locally
  - Dominic mentioned the `--openssl-legacy-provider` tag to circumvent errors
  - Discovered how to use Node Package Manager (`npm`) in the terminal to launch the Frontend
  - Edited the `cdk.json` file with the tag and ran `npm start` which displayed the Frontend in a locally hosted server
