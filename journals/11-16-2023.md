Generating .zip Files for Layers
================================

#### *November 16, 2023*

- Met with Dominic to look at the layout of the AWS Lambda Console
- Showed me how the functions and their layers are created in the console
- Discussed creating new layers and testing them locally
  - Lambda functions (and their layers?) can be tested locally with the SAM CLI

- Attempting to recreate the Models layer by looking at the layer that Dominic sent me
- Based on the contents of this file the only dependencies for the Models layer is `enum` which is a builtin Python library
- How do I specify the runtime of a layer?
  - No dependencies that need to be updated for Models
  - The Models layer for Python 3.7 should be the same for 3.8
  - Can the same .zip file be used to create a new Models layer?

- Emailed Dominic asking for more layers to compare to the Models layer

- According to Dominic when you get something running locally with a template (see hello world guides) you should be able to define/test functions/layers in the new python version as you go
  - Using SAM CLI or some other AWS software?

- Downloaded the .zip files that Dominic shared with me
  - All the layers were still just a single python file
  - The `python/` folder was empty besides the python file
    - Even the ones with non-builtin dependencies did not have any other files
    - Is a layer just a zipped python file?
    - What is the purpose of zipping the file then?
    - How do you update the runtime of a layer then?

- Watched multiple videos on creating AWS Python Lambda layers

- Attempted to create a new Python Lambda layer
  - Created a python virtual environment `venv`
  - Used `pip` to install the required dependencies
  - Zipped a `python/` folder that included the `venv` and the python file for the layer
- After the unzipping the folder that I created, I was left with the original contents
  - My layer was different that the layers sent by Dominic
