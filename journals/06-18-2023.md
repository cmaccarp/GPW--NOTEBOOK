Getting the Backend Running Locally
===================================

#### *June 18, 2023*

- First task from Dominic is to get the backend running locally

<br>

- Met with Anuj to work on the task together
- Read the [README.md](https://github.com/amycayne/GPW--BACKEND/blob/main/README.md) for the backend
  - The README shows how to deploy the backend to AWS
- Attempted to create an AWS account so that we could deploy the backend
  - Discovered that you have to add a credit card to create an AWS account
  - Decided to wait and meet with Dominic

#### *June 20, 2023*

- Met with Dominic and Anuj on Zoom to talk about getting the backend running locally
- Relayed our findings to Dominic
  - Dominic said that we should not need an AWS account
  - Find a way to deploy the backend onto your machine not to AWS
- Searched for a new method
  - Found an AWS documentation of [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-cdk-testing.html)
  - The SAM CLI can be used to locally test individual functions through `sam local invoke`
  - `sam local start` can be used to deploy the backend
    - `start-api`:  start all APIs declared in the application
    - `start-lambda`:  start a local endpoint that emulates AWS Lambda
  - NOTE:  `cdk synth` needs to be run first to create an AWS CloudFormation template

- Met with Anuj to try using AWS SAM
- Attempted to run `cdk synth`
  - Ran into multiple errors
  - After some debugging we had to download some extra AWS CDK packages that were not in `requirements.txt`
- `cdk synth` still encountering errors
  - Realized that I need Docker
    - Docker is a software that builds the backend stacks into containers that can be easily deployed
    - Apparently it is a very popular software
