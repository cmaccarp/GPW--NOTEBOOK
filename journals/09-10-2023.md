Migrating to AWS CDK v2
=======================

*September 10, 2023*

#### Background
- CDK v1 is being deprecated, and lots of errors are occurring due to outdated packages
- Dominic and I decided to upgrade to AWS CDK v2 before continuing with any additions to the codebase

#### Code
- Researched how to migrate to CDK v2
  - Checked the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/migrating-v2.html)
  - Consulted other resources for more specific examples: [Dev](https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-to-migrate-cdk-v1-to-cdk-v2-in-10-minuets-6i6), [Towards the Cloud](https://towardsthecloud.com/migrate-aws-cdk-v2)
- Started with deleting unnecessary flags in `cdk.json` in accordance with AWS docs
- Next step was to edit the `requirements.txt`
  - In CDK v2, the `aws.core` library is deprecated, instead all objects (`App`, `Stack`, `Stage`, etc.) are imported directly from the `aws-cdk-lib` library
  - Changed all the requirements to the new versions
    - Some of the modules are experimental in v2, so I had to add an `@alpha` do designate them
    - Consulted the [AWS Lambda Python Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_lambda_python_alpha/README.html) to find which modules are experimental
- Changed all the `import` statements throughout the codebase to import the necessary libraries and modules
  - Most of the changes to the codebase were editing these `import` statements
- Tested `cdk synth` once more to see if my changes worked
  - Ran into the JSII `RuntimeError` with the `python_lambda.PythonFunction` again
  - Opened a pull request anyways so that Dominic could review the changes
- See the pull request [here](https://github.com/amycayne/GPW--BACKEND/pull/4)
